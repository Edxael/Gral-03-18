# Node.js-API & React.js-UI

This project consist of two parts:
- 01-Weather-Node
- 02-weather-fe

The first is the Node.js API created using the Express.js framework

The Second is a basic React.js App where the user can input data and see the results. 

### NOTE
In order to work the Node.js-API needs to be running in local-host in the same computer that the React.js-UI is running.
